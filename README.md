# S3_Oops_In_Java_LabCycles
This repository contains the solutions of S3 Object Oriented Programming in Java lab works. All solutions in this repository is fully tested successfully.

# Cycle 1

1. print“hello world”
2. add two numbers
3. check given no is odd or even
4. check given no is prime or not
5. find the sum of first “n” natural numbers
6. find the factor of a given number
7. print Fibonacci series
8. factorial of first n numbers
9. check given no is palindrome or not
10.amstrong or not

# Cycle 2

1. Write a Java class having overloaded methods to calculate area of rectangle and circle.

2. Define a class Queue for representing a queue data structure. The class must define a default constructor, a parameterized constructor and functions for enqueue, de-queue and display operations. Write a Java program to implement this.

3. Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor.

4. Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a method named 'returnArea' which returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.

5. Create a class with a method that prints "This is parent class" and its subclass with another method that prints "This is child class". Now, create an object for each of the class and call 1 - method of parent class by object of parent class 2 - method of child class by object of child class 3 - method of parent class by object of child class.
